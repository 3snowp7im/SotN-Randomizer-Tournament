        <h2><a id="rules">Tournament Rules</a></h2>
        <ul>
          <li>This is a 1v1 double elimination tournament.</li>
          <li>The Players <strong>MUST</strong> race using the same seed.</li>
          <li>The seed <strong>MUST</strong> be provided by one of the tournament Referees.</li>
          <li>The seed <strong>MUST</strong> be applied using the “Safe” preset.</li>
          <li>The Players <strong>MUST NOT</strong> have played the seed prior to their match.</li>
          <li>The Players <strong>SHOULD</strong> confirm the seed is correct when it is displayed in-game during the File Select screen’s info text.</li>
          <li>The Players <strong>SHOULD</strong> choose the “Show spoilers” option when patching their game so that they are aware of their starting equipment in order to confirm they are playing the correct seed if they failed to confirm on the File Select screen.</li>
          <li>The Players <strong>MUST NOT</strong> choose the “Show relic locations” option when patching their game.</li>
          <li>All seeds <strong>MUST</strong> be completed in Replay Mode. The Players <strong>MUST NOT</strong> start their game in Axe Armor, Luck, or Richter mode.</li>
          <li>
            The Players <strong>MUST</strong> observe SRL timing for their runs:
            <ul>
              <li>Timing begins when a Player presses Start on the Name Entry screen.</li>
              <li>Timing ends when the Player lands their last hit on Dracula’s true form.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            The Players <strong>MUST</strong> observe the rules of the “Glitchless + Spike Breaker” category (GSB):
            <ul>
              <li>The Players <strong>MAY</strong> use holy water damage stacks on Dracula during the prologue.</li>
              <li>The Players <strong>MUST NOT</strong> skip Death cutscene using any glitches such as RSL.</li>
              <li>The Players <strong>MAY</strong> skip Death cutscene using a Library Card if they received one as a random enemy drop, in a breakable wall, or, as a prologue reward.</li>
              <li>The Players <strong>MAY</strong> use untransform mechanics to reach otherwise restricted areas. This includes, for instance, dive-kicking the candle under the clock room entrance to Olrox’s Quarters and chaining Gravity Boots without Leapstone.</li>
              <li>The Players <strong>MAY</strong> use Wolf stair jumping mechanics to reach otherwise restricted areas.</li>
              <li>The Players <strong>MUST NOT</strong> use any shop glitches such as saleable gem duping.</li>
              <li>Spike Breaker <strong>MUST</strong> be equipped while going through the spike hallway in Royal Chapel.</li>
              <li>The Players <strong>MUST NOT</strong> use potion abuse in order to go through the jewel door in the spike hallway in Royal Chapel.</li>
              <li>The Players <strong>MUST NOT</strong> perform any wall or floor clips or zips. This includes, for instance, RSL and stair clipping using Wolf untransform.</li>
              <li>The Players <strong>MUST NOT</strong> skip the Gold and Silver Ring puzzle. The Players <strong>MUST</strong> obtain both the Gold and Silver Rings and wait for the clock room floor to open normally.</li>
              <li>The Players <strong>MUST</strong> obtain Holy Glasses before reaching the second castle.</li>
              <li>The Players <strong>MUST NOT</strong> skip Richter Belmont using any glitches such as Wolf or Bat skip.</li>
              <li>The Players <strong>MUST NOT</strong> skip the second castle relic puzzle using any glitches. The Players <strong>MUST</strong> obtain all five Vlad relics and wait for the second castle clock room ceiling to open normally.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>The Players <strong>MUST NOT</strong> use turbo controllers or controllers that allow pressing opposing directional inputs at the same time (left + right or up + down).</li>
          <li>The Players <strong>MAY</strong> use “Save splitting”. That is to say, the Players may wish to save before branching off from their progression paths towards possibly worthless, yet time consuming, relic checks. In the worst case scenario, the Players are allowed to reset and load from their saves in order to avoid the time spent backtracking. Both soft resets [holding START + SELECT] and hard resets are allowed.</li>
          <li>The Players <strong>MUST NOT</strong> use save states.</li>
          <li>The Players <strong>MAY</strong> choose to restart their match and keep their seed if they both agree and it is reasonably early into their match. Reasons for restarting <strong>MAY</strong> include, but are not limited to, a particularly bad prologue fight, or a death early in the match. Reasons for restarting <strong>MUST NOT</strong> include a regrettable routing choice. While Players are encouraged to make their best efforts in overcoming the odds rather than restarting, Referees will recognize that stronger competition is often more fun for the Players and audience, and that may require restarting the match.</li>
          <li>The Players <strong>MUST</strong> consult with a Referee in the event of a softlock or emulator crash. Please be advised that there are no known unavoidable crashes using randomized game files on PS1, PS2, or “accurate” emulators, such as the most recent versions of Bizhawk and PSXjin, and that using anything else may result in a Player’s disqualification.</li>
